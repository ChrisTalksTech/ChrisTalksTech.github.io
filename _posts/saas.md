# Things To Consider With Cloud documentation 
Making the switch from an On-Premise product to a Software as a Service (SaaS) product has its challenges for technical teams, but there are also things to consider when it comes to Documentation.
## Content 
Switching from On-Prem software to Cloud SaaS, there can be considerable changes to content as your product offering changes shape. We might see the following changes:
- Product features are stripped back.
- Customisation is now limited or not supported.
- Installation or Upgrade Guides are no longer required.
- Versioning is no longer required and a Change Log or Updates information page is maintained.

## Delivery
In a Cloud or SaaS organisation, you might be expected to work in line with developnment teams and adopt [continuous methodologies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/index.html#introduction-to-cicd-methodologies). Automation, Testing, Reviews, and Deployment strategies are requiredto support continuous integration and delivery.

## Availability
Cloud computing services should be always available. As a SaaS provider, you will have most likely have Service Level Agreements or contractual commitments to adhere to. A SaaS customer would expect the same availability with documentation and so good practices are essential when it comes to writing and building documentation.

## Competition
Cloud computing is a highly competitive market, prospective customers will compare Features, Pricing, Support, Return On Investment, and other factors to make their decision. You should definitely expect customers to compare documentation when it comes to researching cloud services. Comprehensive user-friendly documentation is the order of the day.
