title: What does a Tech Writer do?
---

##


### Content and Delivery
At all levels, a tech writer is expected to manage a documentation set. The tech writer may also be responsible for the delivery of content, such as a docs website, e-book, or scientific-paper.

A software technical writer could be managing a set of documentation, as well as the front-end technology used to deliver the content. A basic understanding of coding practice and computing technologies are a good starting point. 
An engineering technical writer, such as mechanical engineering, could work on physical manuals, book-type content, and include more graphics or diagrams. 
Science technical writers would likely come from a science background or science degree, and follow scietific documentation standards.
Both content and delivery can differ greatly, depending on the industry. You might find that you become an integral part of internal processes, I've heard terms that tech writers act as the single source of truth, or provide consistent voice. 

### Working with Stakeholders
Tech writers must work with stakeholders at all levels. It's part of what makes the job interesting. When writing, you're ultimately thinking about your reader, end-user, or customer. But you also might work with managers to meet business requirements, subject matter experts (SMEs) to provide accurate information, or a senior director who wants to [change terminology](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinet-office-100/the-supersonic-airliner/concord-or-concorde/).   
You might find that the same approach doesn't work for everyone, some people prefer a face-to-face, some prefer an email. You might also collaborate with people in another location. Tailoring your approach is another way you can become a great part of the team.
