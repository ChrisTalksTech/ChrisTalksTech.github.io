## The Problem:
Recently, I found myself documenting a browser UI. The devs provided a nice test environment for me to play around with and take screenshots etc. The problem was, they had named my test user 'Chris'. Real names don't belong in documentation these days, for data protection reasons. But I think it looks better to have generic names like, *Administrator* or *Username*.

I can't share the product I was working on at the time, but I thought I'd share how you can change HTML elements from the browser developer console. 
A GIF speaks a thousand words:
./ChangingUIText.gif

I hope this helps someone with their web app documentation. :)
